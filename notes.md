# Introduction
## Why you need to know about artificial intelligence

-   Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly present in the workplace.
-   Applications include discovering pharmaceuticals, recommending products, and detecting fraud.
-   This course provides a high-level overview of AI concepts and technology.
-   It covers what makes a system "intelligent," widely used machine learning algorithms, and artificial neural networks.
-   The target audience includes business professionals, entrepreneurs, managers, and students who will interact with AI systems.
-   The role of a manager will evolve to include working with AI systems and data, similar to how they currently work with software developers.

# 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?
## Define general intelligence

-   **Human Intelligence is Diverse:** Humans exhibit various types of intelligence (e.g., linguistic, scientific, artistic), and there is no single standard.
-   **Computer Intelligence is Different:** Computers excel at specific tasks, particularly those involving set rules and pattern matching.
    -   They began beating humans at Checkers shortly after the first AI workshop in 1956.
    -   Computers have beaten the best human players in Chess for decades.
    -   Google's DeepMind defeated the top player in Go, a game with more possible moves than atoms in the universe.
-   **Lack of Understanding:** Despite their capabilities, these systems do not understand the purpose or meaning of the games they play. They are simply executing their specialized talent for following rules and matching patterns.
-   **Defining AI is Challenging:**
    -   A common definition: A system that shows behavior that could be interpreted as human intelligence.
    -   This definition is subjective. One person might find a chess program intelligent, while another sees a home assistant as intelligent.
    -   **Example:** In 2022, a Google engineer claimed a chatbot had a soul because it expressed a fear of being "switched off." Other engineers saw this as sophisticated language modeling and pattern matching designed to sound human.
-   **Key Takeaway for Organizations:**
    -   AI is most impressive and effective in domains with set rules and data.
    -   Organizations that work within well-defined spaces (like web search and e-commerce) are the first to benefit.
    -   To assess AI's potential impact, look for areas with significant pattern matching, set rules, and probabilities.

## The general problem-solver

-   **The General Problem Solver (GPS):** A program created in 1956 by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon.
-   **Physical Symbol System Hypothesis:** The core idea behind GPS.
    -   It proposed that intelligence could be achieved by programming a machine to connect symbols to meanings or actions (e.g., stop sign -> stop, letter A -> sound, sandwich -> eating).
-   **The Chinese Room Argument:** A thought experiment by philosopher John Searle (1980) to argue against the idea that symbol manipulation equals intelligence.
    -   **Scenario:** A person who doesn't speak Chinese is in a locked room. They receive Chinese symbols through a mail slot. Using a detailed rule book (a "phrase book"), they match the incoming symbols to the correct output symbols and send them back out.
    -   **Result:** A native Chinese speaker outside might believe they are having a real conversation with someone who understands Chinese.
    -   **Argument:** The person inside the room is simply matching patterns without any understanding of the language or the conversation. Searle argued that this is how computers operateâ€”they mindlessly match symbols without true comprehension.
    -   Modern AI assistants like Siri or Cortana operate similarly, matching a user's question to a pre-programmed response.
-   **Limitations of Symbol Systems:**
    -   Symbolic systems were the foundation of AI for 25 years.
    -   The primary challenge was a **"combinatorial explosion."** The number of possible symbol combinations and rules grew too large to be programmed, making the "phrase book" impossibly big.

## Strong vs. weak AI

-   Philosopher John Searle categorized AI into two types: strong AI and weak AI.
-   **Strong AI:**
    -   A machine that exhibits the full range of human cognitive abilities and consciousness.
    -   It would have emotions, a sense of humor, creativity, and self-awareness.
    -   This is the type of AI typically seen in science fiction (e.g., C-3PO's fear, Commander Data's creativity).
    -   Strong AI is considered to be purely theoretical and does not exist today.
-   **Weak AI (or Narrow AI):**
    -   AI that is designed and trained for a specific, narrow task.
    -   Examples: Apple's Siri, language processing, sorting photos.
    -   This is where almost all current AI development and energy is focused.
-   **Expert Systems:**
    -   A common form of weak AI in the 1970s and 80s, based on symbolic systems. Also known as **GOFAI** (Good Old-Fashioned AI).
    -   Human experts create a detailed list of rules (if-then statements) to solve a complex problem.
    -   **Example (Medicine):** A program guides a nurse through a diagnosis by matching symptoms to a pre-programmed decision tree.
        -   If `cough`, then check `temperature`.
        -   If `cough` AND `temperature`, then check for `dehydration`.
        -   If `cough`, `temperature`, AND `dehydration`, then check for `bronchitis`.
    -   To an observer, the system might seem intelligent, but it's just following a script created by experts, much like the person in the Chinese Room.
    -   **Limitation:** Expert systems faced the same "combinatorial explosion" problem as other symbolic systems; it was impossible for experts to program every possible scenario.

## Chapter Quiz

**Question 1 of 3**

Why did some of the earliest artificial intelligence systems focus on board games such as checkers and chess?

-   **It's easiest to make a computer system seem intelligent when it's working with set rules and patterns.**
-   **Explanation:** Early computers had limited processing power. Board games provided a constrained environment with simple rules and patterns, which was ideal for these early AI systems.

**Question 2 of 3**

Luella seeks medical attention for chest pains. A nurse uses an artificial intelligence program to diagnose the cause. Why is this system likely not really intelligent?

-   **The program only matches her symptoms to steps in a system an expert created.**
-   **Explanation:** This is an example of a weak AI expert system. It doesn't "think" but rather follows a pre-programmed logic tree designed by human doctors. It lacks genuine understanding.

**Question 3 of 3**

You're a product manager who's in charge of building a weak AI expert system that will give tax advice. You're working with dozens of accountants who go through thousands of different taxpayer scenarios. When a customer asks a question, then the expert system will ask a follow-up question. It will do this until it makes a recommendation. What's one of the biggest challenges with this system?

-   **There will be too many tax combinations for the experts to cover with one system.**
-   **Explanation:** This illustrates the problem of "combinatorial explosion." In a complex domain like taxes, the number of possible scenarios, questions, and rules becomes so vast that it's practically impossible for experts to program every single one.
